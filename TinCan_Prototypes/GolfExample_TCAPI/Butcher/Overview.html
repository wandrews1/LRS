            <br>
            <p> For a little bit of history, the use of a butcher block first originated in China, though Europeans have used butcher blocks for centuries as well. The concept was to have a sturdy base on which to butcher meat, hence, the "butcher block". The physical act of chopping is also why these blocks are also commonly called chopping block as well.</p>

            <p>In the past, just about anything could pass for a block, be it a tree stump, log round or even a flat rock (though we imagine that idea didn't last long due to the damage to the knives). These days, butcher blocks are be described as anything from a round 5" wood board to a stand alone table to a 20 square foot kitchen island. No wonder there's some confusion as to the technical definition of a butcher block, because the reality is that the definition is in the eye of the beholder and you can see our butcher blocks in varying shapes and sizes. </p>
